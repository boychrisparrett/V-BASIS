The purpose of this basic model is to visualizes the dynamics of community transmission of a novel disease and the effects that social distance has on a population. Viral Basic Asymptomatic Spread and Impact of Social-Distance (V-BASIS) provides a simple graphic interface for researchers or interested parties can use to observe and analyze the results of community spread on different populations.
